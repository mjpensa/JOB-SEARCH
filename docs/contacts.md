# Networking Contacts

## Tracy M. Kerrins
**Current role:** Consumer CIO at Wells Fargo
**Relationship:** Direct working relationship on the Data Resiliency Risk Strategy project (EY). Matthew presented to her multiple times alongside the EY team led by Carl Liebel.
**Status:** She accepted Matthew's LinkedIn connection request (Sep 2025). He sent a follow-up message (Oct 2025) asking for career advice and mentioning Charlotte — she has not responded.
**Outreach rules:** Warm contact who knows his work, but the previous outreach misfired. Any future message must reset the dynamic — lead with value or a substantive AI governance insight relevant to her GenAI work, not another ask for time. Do not send generic networking language to this contact. The next message needs to be worth her time on its own, regardless of whether she responds.
