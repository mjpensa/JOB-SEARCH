## Notes on what "good" looks like for Matthew's cover letters:
- Opening: 1-2 sentences max. Reference a specific company initiative or recent development + your most relevant credential. No "I am writing to express my interest."
- Body P1: Map 2-3 specific resume achievements directly to the top JD requirements, with metrics.
- Body P2: Demonstrate domain expertise through natural use of regulatory/technical vocabulary (SR 11-7, NIST AI RMF, three lines of defense) — not by listing certifications.
- Close: Specific value proposition + concrete next step. No "I look forward to hearing from you."
- Total length: Under 400 words.
