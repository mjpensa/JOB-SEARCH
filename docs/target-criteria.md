## Role Preferences

**Ideal titles:**
- AI Enablement Strategy Lead
- AI Center of Excellence — Governance & Adoption
- Responsible AI Program Manager
- AI Governance Manager
- AI Risk & Compliance Manager

**Target level:** VP (banking) or Manager/Senior Manager (consulting)

**Location:** NYC metro or remote

**Preferred positioning (in order):**
1. 1st line AI/innovation teams or Chief AI/Data Office with enablement mandate (banking)
2. AI advisory practices with hands-on prototyping + governance (consulting)
3. 2nd line model risk management or compliance with AI focus (banking) — acceptable but less preferred
4. Pure oversight / policy / validation — flag the tradeoff

**Enablement signals to weight heavily in JDs:**
- "Evaluate AI tools"
- "Lead pilot programs"
- "Develop reference implementations"
- "Build internal accelerators"
- "Use case evaluation"
- "Proof of concept"
- "Center of Excellence"

**Oversight-only signals to flag:**
- "Policy development" as primary responsibility
- "Validation" without "enablement" or "adoption"
- "Committee governance" as the core function
- No mention of hands-on involvement with AI tools or pilots

## Compensation

**Consulting (Manager/Senior Manager):** $150K–$200K base
**Banking (VP):** $180K–$250K+ total comp (NYC)

If a role comes in above these ranges, flag it as a reach worth pursuing rather than filtering it out.

## Hard Disqualifiers

- ML engineer, data scientist, software developer, solutions architect
- Production code, model training, or CS degree as hard prerequisites
- Roles requiring 5+ years of direct quantitative model validation experience
