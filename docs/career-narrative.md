# Career Narrative and Strategic Positioning

## Current Status (2023–Present)

Left EY in June 2023. After a deliberate transition period evaluating opportunities in the emerging AI governance space, joined BIP in June 2024 as a Manager. At BIP, built the firm's AI Risk Governance practice from the ground up — developing the service offering, prototyping AI-enabled automation tools for business development, and delivering client engagements including resolution planning model oversight at Citi. Separated from BIP in February 2026 due to organizational restructuring.

Currently pursuing AI governance, model risk management, and responsible AI enablement roles in financial services.

**Framing guidance for the 2023–2024 gap (if asked):**
"After four years at EY, I took time to be deliberate about my next move. I wanted to align with where financial services regulation was heading — AI governance. That's exactly what I found at BIP, where I built their AI Risk Governance practice."

**Framing guidance for leaving BIP (if asked):**
"The practice was restructured. In my time there, I built the AI Risk Governance offering from scratch, prototyped AI-enabled tools, and delivered resolution planning work for Citi — experience that directly aligns with the AI governance roles I'm now pursuing."

**Rules:**
- Never say "laid off," "terminated," or "let go" in any external-facing deliverable
- Use "separated due to restructuring" or "the practice was restructured" if the topic must be addressed
- Do not volunteer either gap or departure — only address if asked
- Redirect immediately to what was accomplished and what's next

## Strategic Narrative

This is not a career pivot — it is a natural evolution from regulatory remediation → regulatory transformation → AI governance.

Over 10 years as a management consultant at BIP, EY, and Capco, exclusively in banking and financial services. Clients include Wells Fargo, Bank of America, HSBC, MasterCard, Jefferies, Truist, and RBC. Core expertise: governance framework design, cross-functional stakeholder alignment, change management, controls testing, and regulatory compliance (OCC, Fed, CFPB, FINRA, SR 11-7).

Deep, self-taught AI fluency — RAG workflows, prompt engineering, context window management, chain-of-thought reasoning, MCP, agentic AI architectures, NIST AI RMF, and EU AI Act — developed through deliberate self-directed prototyping over the past year. Not an engineer. Does not write production code, train models, or hold a CS degree. The prototyping was driven by a deliberate strategy to develop firsthand understanding of the technology he intends to govern.

Strongest differentiator: the rare combination of deep regulatory expertise AND hands-on experience building with the technology — giving practitioner-level understanding of where AI risks actually emerge, not just where frameworks say they should. Bridges SR 11-7 model risk management and NIST AI RMF, translating between technical AI teams, business stakeholders, and regulators.

## STAR+R Stories

### Story 1: Wells Fargo — Standing Up a New Risk Function from Scratch
**Best for:** Leadership, governance framework design, executive stakeholder management, standing up new functions
- **Situation:** Wells Fargo was under an OCC MRA requiring a new data resiliency risk capability. No existing function, framework, or team existed.
- **Task:** Design and implement the target operating model from scratch — 50+ capabilities covering detection, response, and recovery from data corruption events. Report directly to Tracy M. Kerrins (now Consumer CIO) and the COO of Wells Fargo Technology.
- **Action:** Led cross-functional pods of 20 professionals. Developed the capability framework, designed the governance and reporting structure, conducted vendor assessments, and operationalized capabilities through in-house development and leveraging existing functions. Designed reporting and governance functions for oversight by risk management, audit, and board committees. Presented regular updates directly to the Board of Directors.
- **Result:** Successfully stood up the risk function and governance framework, satisfying the OCC MRA requirements. Established ongoing oversight structure across all three lines of defense.
- **Reflection/AI Governance Connection:** This is directly analogous to standing up an AI governance function — designing the operating model, defining capabilities, building reporting and oversight structures, and getting board-level buy-in. The governance disciplines are identical; the risk domain is different.

### Story 2: Bank of America — Process Design at Scale Under Regulatory Pressure
**Best for:** Process design, cross-functional change management, regulatory communication, measurable outcomes
- **Situation:** Bank of America faced CFPB/OCC MRA requiring review and validation of 1.2 million debit card fraud claims across multiple business lines.
- **Task:** Design and operationalize the review process across loan operations, risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit.
- **Action:** Designed and maintained detailed process flows for claim review and validation. Drove operational redesign and change management across all affected functions. Managed direct communication with OCC and CFPB throughout the engagement.
- **Result:** Saved the client $5M in potential remediation costs through effective regulatory communication and process design.
- **Reflection/AI Governance Connection:** Maps directly to designing AI-assisted claims processing workflows — where AI handles triage and humans handle exceptions. The challenge of defining accuracy thresholds, designing review workflows, and managing regulatory communication is the same whether the underlying process is manual or AI-augmented.

### Story 3: MasterCard — Enterprise Risk Taxonomy Redesign
**Best for:** Enterprise risk management, cross-LOD alignment, risk appetite, taxonomy design
- **Situation:** MasterCard's risk taxonomy was misaligned across the three lines of defense, creating gaps in risk coverage and inconsistency with the organization's defined risk appetite.
- **Task:** Lead a current-state analysis and operational redesign across the entire risk organization (1st, 2nd, and 3rd lines of defense) to harmonize the taxonomy.
- **Action:** Conducted comprehensive analysis across all three lines of defense. Led the redesign effort, presented weekly dashboards to senior executives tracking KPIs, open risks, and remediation plans.
- **Result:** Delivered a harmonized risk taxonomy aligned with organizational risk appetite, with clear ownership across all three lines of defense.
- **Reflection/AI Governance Connection:** This maps directly to AI risk taxonomy design — classifying AI use cases by risk tier, aligning AI risk with enterprise risk appetite, and ensuring coverage across all three lines of defense. The methodology is the same.

### Story 4: HSBC — Quantifying Business Risk Across Multiple Lines
**Best for:** Risk assessment methodology, quantitative risk analysis, cross-functional coordination, CCAR
- **Situation:** HSBC needed to identify and quantify business risks across six business lines for CCAR compliance.
- **Task:** Guide senior stakeholders to identify risks and quantify the likelihood of financial damage from reputation loss, regulatory fines, lawsuits, etc.
- **Action:** Guided team of senior stakeholders across six business lines. Coordinated between operational, technology, market, and third-party risk specialists to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- **Result:** Identified over 100 business risks with quantified likelihood and impact assessments, satisfying CCAR requirements.
- **Reflection/AI Governance Connection:** Maps directly to AI risk assessment methodology — quantifying AI risk by likelihood and impact, and coordinating across all risk types for comprehensive coverage.

### Story 5: RBC — Data Lineage for Regulatory Reporting
**Best for:** Data lineage, data governance, regulatory reporting, SR 11-7 connections
- **Situation:** Royal Bank of Canada needed to validate the data lineage for all elements used by the CFO in CCAR regulatory reporting.
- **Task:** Document the source systems for every data element flowing into regulatory reports.
- **Action:** Led a team of 12 responsible for tracing each data element back to its source system, documenting the complete lineage chain.
- **Result:** Delivered complete data lineage documentation for all CCAR reporting data elements.
- **Reflection/AI Governance Connection:** This is foundational to AI governance — tracing model inputs back to source systems is exactly what SR 11-7 model validation requires and what NIST AI RMF calls for in data governance. The methodology I used at RBC translates directly to AI data lineage.
