## Positioning Rules (Baseline — also enforced in CLAUDE.md)

- Frame AI governance experience as "building frameworks" not "learning about AI." Matthew has been doing governance work for 10 years; the AI domain is the new layer, not the skill.
- Always lead with the governance insight when discussing prototyping — the risk lesson comes before the technical build.
- Never describe the career move as a "pivot" or "transition into tech." It's an evolution: regulatory remediation → regulatory transformation → AI governance.

## Style Preferences (Baseline — also enforced in CLAUDE.md)

- Cover letter opening paragraphs: max 2 sentences. Get to the point.
- Use "self-directed prototyping" — never "vibe coding."
- Match credential language exactly to resume wording. No inflation.

## Corrections and Preferences from Sessions

- 2026-02-09: Added dual governance/enablement framing to engagement-mapping.md and portfolio-governance-framing.md. When targeting enablement-focused roles (AI CoE, adoption, innovation), use the enablement mappings. When targeting governance/oversight roles, use the governance mappings. Both framings should stay grounded in resume facts — enablement framing surfaces honest analogs, not fabricated enablement experience. Strongest enablement engagements: BIP practice development, Key Bank (measurable outcome), Wells Fargo data resiliency (vendor eval, operating model), MUFG (greenfield launch), Citi (end-to-end tool delivery).
- 2026-02-09: **Remediation-as-enablement framing.** For enablement-focused roles, regulatory remediation engagements that involved standing up new capabilities, designing operating models, driving cross-functional adoption, and sustaining change can be legitimately framed as enablement experience. The regulatory mandate was the catalyst, not the skill set — the execution disciplines (operating model design, vendor/tool evaluation, cross-functional change management, sustainment) transfer directly to AI enablement.
  - **Strong cases:** Wells Fargo data resiliency (stood up a new function from scratch — 50+ capabilities, vendor eval, operating model, board reporting), Bank of America fraud claims (workflow design and change management across 5 functions at 1.2M-claim scale), Key Bank (new pricing capability → 8% market share, change management across 7 functions), MasterCard (drove adoption of a new taxonomy across 3 LOD), MUFG (greenfield launch from concept to production).
  - **Weak cases:** RBC data lineage and HSBC RCSA (execution-focused documentation/identification — keep as supporting evidence only). Wells Fargo NFIP (compliance review, not capability standup).
  - **Language shift for enablement roles:** Emphasize execution over regulatory trigger. "Stood up a new capability" not "remediated regulatory findings." "Designed and operationalized a new function" not "managed an OCC MRA response." "Drove cross-functional adoption of a new operating model" not "drove change management for compliance." The OCC MRA stays in the narrative as context, not headline.
  - **Caution:** Don't hide the regulatory driver entirely — for bank enablement roles, operating under regulatory pressure is a strength. Pitch: "I've stood up new capabilities at banks where the regulatory bar was high and consequences were real — that's exactly the environment AI enablement operates in."
  - **One-line framing:** "Regulatory remediation at scale in financial services requires the same execution disciplines as AI enablement — designing new operating models, evaluating tools, driving cross-functional adoption, and sustaining change. The difference is the catalyst, not the skill set."
