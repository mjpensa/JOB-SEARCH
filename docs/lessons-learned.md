## Positioning Rules (Baseline — also enforced in CLAUDE.md)

- Frame AI governance experience as "building frameworks" not "learning about AI." Matthew has been doing governance work for 10 years; the AI domain is the new layer, not the skill.
- Always lead with the governance insight when discussing prototyping — the risk lesson comes before the technical build.
- Never describe the career move as a "pivot" or "transition into tech." It's an evolution: regulatory remediation → regulatory transformation → AI governance.

## Style Preferences (Baseline — also enforced in CLAUDE.md)

- Cover letter opening paragraphs: max 2 sentences. Get to the point.
- Use "self-directed prototyping" — never "vibe coding."
- Match credential language exactly to resume wording. No inflation.
