# Engagement-to-AI Mapping

When drawing on consulting experience for cover letters, interview answers, or job fit analysis, use these connections to bridge past work to AI governance and AI enablement positioning.

Each engagement includes both a **governance mapping** (for oversight, risk, and compliance roles) and an **enablement mapping** (for adoption, CoE, and innovation roles) where a legitimate angle exists. Use the mapping that matches the target role's emphasis.

## Citi — Resolution Planning / Wind-Down Calculation Tool (BIP)

**What he did:** Managed the design and development of a wind-down calculation tool for bank resolution planning. Oversaw development of an end-user GUI and a complex underlying model that accepts scenario parameters and generates wind-down guidance based on real-world conditions. Coordinated across technology, risk, and business stakeholders.

**Maps to AI governance:** This is model governance in practice — overseeing the development of a complex model, designing how users interact with model inputs and outputs, ensuring reliable guidance for high-stakes regulatory decisions. Maps directly to SR 11-7 model risk management: model development oversight, input validation, output review, and end-user controls. The resolution planning context also demonstrates comfort with systemic risk — the highest-stakes regulatory domain.

**Maps to AI enablement:** End-to-end delivery of a new tool for business users — from design through development to adoption. Overseeing the GUI design demonstrates focus on how end users actually interact with model outputs, not just whether the model is valid. Coordinating across technology, risk, and business stakeholders to ensure the tool served its intended purpose is the core enablement skill: bridging technical capability and business adoption.

**Use when discussing:** Model risk management, model development oversight, SR 11-7 compliance, complex model governance, high-stakes decision support systems, AI model lifecycle management, or delivering AI-enabled tools to business users.

## BIP — AI Risk Governance Practice Development (Internal)

**What he did:** Built BIP's AI Risk Governance practice from scratch — defined service capabilities, target market positioning, and delivery methodology. Prototyped AI-enabled automation tools to support business development and demonstrate practice capabilities to prospective clients.

**Maps to AI governance:** Direct experience standing up an AI governance function — defining what the practice does, how it delivers value, and what tools it uses. The prototyping work provides firsthand understanding of AI-enabled automation risks and capabilities. This is the closest possible analog to building an AI governance program inside a financial institution.

**Maps to AI enablement:** Prototyped AI-enabled automation tools to demonstrate practice capabilities to prospective clients and support business development — the proof-of-concept and feasibility validation workflow that AI Centers of Excellence use internally. Defined the service capabilities and delivery methodology for how a new AI practice would operate. This is the closest analog to standing up an AI enablement function inside a financial institution: identifying use cases, proving feasibility through prototyping, and positioning AI capabilities for adoption.

**Use when discussing:** Building AI governance programs from scratch, defining AI governance service offerings, AI strategy, demonstrating entrepreneurial initiative in AI governance, proof-of-concept development, or building an AI CoE operating model.

Also presented directly to the COO of Wells Fargo Technology and the Board of Directors.

**Maps to AI governance:** AI model monitoring and drift detection, operational resilience frameworks for AI systems, and governance structures for newly launched risk functions.

**Maps to AI enablement:** Operationalized 50+ capabilities through a mix of in-house development, vendor assessments, and leveraging existing functions. Vendor/tool evaluation and selection is a direct analog to evaluating AI tools for a business unit. Designed the target operating model for a new capability — not just the policy, but how the function would actually work operationally. Designed reporting and governance structures that embedded the new capability into existing business unit workflows, enabling robust oversight by risk management, audit, and board committees.

**Use when discussing:** AI operational risk, model monitoring, standing up new AI governance functions from scratch, vendor/tool evaluation and selection, target operating model design, or operationalizing new technology-enabled capabilities.
